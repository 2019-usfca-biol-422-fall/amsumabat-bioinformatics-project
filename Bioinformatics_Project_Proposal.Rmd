# Overview of Proposed Project 

My plan for this semester-long project is to analyze the microbiome of used sponges. I will be comparing kitchen sponges used in my personal kitchen with used kitchen sponges that are used by employees in the breakroom at my work. In my personal kitchen at home, sponges are used to clean dishes and utensils that have been used for eating and preparing meals. I work at a retail store where we are provided sponges in our breakroom to allow for us to clean our tupperwares. 

Research has shown that kitchen environments are prone to harboring bacteria due to food handling and direct contact to humans. [@cardinale2017microbiome] There is also research that states the possibility of foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella, surviving washes and being able to transfer to other surfaces wherein which humans can come to direct contact with. [@mattick2003survival] The main source of bacteria found in kitchen environment comes from food. Aside from food skin is said to be a major source of baceteria found in kitchen environments. [@flores2013diversity]  In the breakroom of my work, there are close to 100 people handling the same sponge. That same sponge is used to clean all sorts of dishes that have contained a variety of food. In my kitchen, the number of people handling the sponge is limited to only the 6 people in my family.

# Study Design

I will swab the surface of used sponges from my home as well as swab the surface of used sponges in the breakroom of my work. I will culture the bacteria from the obtained samples and compare and contrast the bacteria found from the samples I have taken. 

# Question 

The question that I will be working to address is, "Does the number of people getting in contact with a used sponge affect the diversity of the microbiome that is found within it?" 

# Hypothesis 

The sponge used in the breakroom of my work will have a more diverse microbiome than the sponge used in a personal kitchen. 

# Materials  

* 6 sterile cotton swabs 

* 6 sterile tubes with sterile buffer 

* used sponge from personal kitchen at home 

* used sponge from breakroom at my work 

# Methods 

1. I will obtain my samples for this project during my one-hour break before class on Tuesday. I may take more than one hour and will possibly be late by approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour. 
2. Swab the surface of a used sponge from personal kitchen at home. 
3. Repeat two more times to obtain a total of three samples from the same sponge.
4. Swab the surface of a used sponge from the breakroom of my work.
5. Repeat two more times to obtain a total of three samples from the same sponge. 
6. Bring samples to class.
